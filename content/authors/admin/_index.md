I am currently serving as a Senior Technical Advisor at the Federal Trade Commission’s [Office of Technology](https://www.ftc.gov/about-ftc/bureaus-offices/office-technology), where I leverage my expertise on privacy, automated systems, and applied machine learning to further the agency’s mission to protect consumers and promote fair competition. 

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow within Roya Ensafi’s [Censored Planet Lab](https://ensa.fi/) in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) School at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. I collaborated on projects that examined the impact of geoblocking on citizens in sanctioned states as well as the development of machine learning and outlier detection methodologies to identify censorship events and content.

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) at UC Irvine and was advised by [Athina Markopoulou](https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/athina/) and part of the [ProperData NSF Frontier](https://properdata.eng.uci.edu/) project. My doctoral studies centers on privacy and networking to improve the (1) transparency of data collection practices of different platforms such as the [web](https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/projects/ats-on-the-web/), [smart TVs](https://levanhieu.com/publication/smarttv_pets_2020/) and [Oculus VR](https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/projects/ovrseen/); and the (2) control of data collection by designing [frameworks and methodologies](https://athinagroup.eng.uci.edu/projects/ats-on-the-web/) to automate the pain-points of privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) that block advertising and tracking on the web.
