abstract: "Modern social media platforms, such as TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube, rely on recommendation systems to personalize content for users based on user interactions with endless streams of content, such as 'For You' pages. However, these complex algorithms can inadvertently deliver problematic content related to self-harm, mental health, and eating disorders. We introduce AutoLike, a framework to audit recommendation systems in social media platforms for topics of interest and their sentiments. To automate the process, we formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem. AutoLike drives the recommendation system to serve a particular type of content through interactions (e.g., liking). We apply the AutoLike framework to the TikTok platform as a case study. We evaluate how well AutoLike identifies TikTok content automatically across nine topics of interest; and conduct eight experiments to demonstrate how well it drives TikTok's recommendation system towards particular topics and sentiments. AutoLike has the potential to assist regulators in auditing recommendation systems for problematic content. (Warning: This paper contains qualitative examples that may be viewed as offensive or harmful.)"
